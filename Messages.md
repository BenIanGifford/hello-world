#What is this?

Hi! Thanks for reading this. We're here to talk about how awesome it'd be if we could all contribute things via a pull request.


First off, this is written in markdown, the most awesome templating language out there. For more on markdown, see [the commonmark project](http://commonmark.org/).


Second, this is on GitHub, the social network for programming for fun and profit.

I highly recommend looking at this and saying "oooh, aahhh".

And you can do emoji. For emoji stuff, look up the emoji cheat sheet for GitHub, available on the internet [here](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).
